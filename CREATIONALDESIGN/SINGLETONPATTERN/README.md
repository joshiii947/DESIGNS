The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class.
Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.



1. The Singleton class declares the static method getInstance that returns the same instance of its own class.

The Singletonâ€™s constructor should be hidden from the client code. Calling the getInstance method should be the only way of getting the Singleton object.
